This is the Task was given by the zithara technologies

I would like to explain that how i will do the task 

first we installed the three application nodejs,reactjs and postgresql

nodejs for connectivity of data ,
react js for the application in frontend ,
postgresql is used for the database connectivity

nodejs is installed after that we installed the npm install pg and npm install and create the database.
reactjs is installed after that we installed the react scripts and npm install and we create the applications in that folder.
postgresql is installed after that we create the one database ,then the database is there in the tables data, we created one table.
